## Coding style points
wrapping line limit is 79 columns.

Using high-level features of C++ are only allowed in test directory.

I am using following naming convention for all names:
temp_variable, spmv_csr

For typyes and classes let's use Clang format e.g., ClassName

Functions more than 39 lines are not recommended.

There should NOT be any main function in the code other than demo directory.

Create a separate util file for each demo to keep the demo main file easy to follow.

If you are using any extra dependency make sure the code runs correctly without having that otherwise that is a required library. For example Metis is an optional and the code should run well with no Metis.

Never forget running valgrind and fixing memory leaks.

Writing a test for new modules are recommended.

Two namespaces are used in this repository sym_lib and sympiler. Any new class/function should be within these two namespace.

Create a branch for solving an issue.
